This repository contains my project submission for my university module [Theory of Algorithms](https://www.gmit.ie/theory-of-algorithms)[0].

In this module, you are encouraged to compare different models of computation,
write computer programs in a variety of different programming languages,
and identify computational problems in everyday computing.

The topics to be covered in this project[1], are the following:
1. The Polynomial Time Complexity Class (P)
