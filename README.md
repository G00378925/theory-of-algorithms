This repository contains my project submission for my university module
[Theory of Algorithms](https://www.gmit.ie/theory-of-algorithms)[0].

The topic to be covered in this project[1] is the
**The Polynomial Time Complexity Class ($P$)**.

$P$ is a class of **decision problems** that can be solved in **deterministic polynomial time** on a **deterministic Turing machine**,
this class is sometimes also referred to as $PTIME$.[2]
In the notebook `polynomial_time.ipynb`, I will break this explanation into its individual meanings.

Explaining what decision problems are, what is meant by **deterministic** time, and an implementation of a Turing machine.

You can view this notebook on [GitHub](https://github.com/G00378925/theory-of-algorithms/blob/main/polynomial_time.ipynb),
but to display everything correctly and run code, you should instead use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install).
