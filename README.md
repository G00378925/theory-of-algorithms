This repository contains my project submission for my university module
[Theory of Algorithms](https://www.gmit.ie/theory-of-algorithms)[0].

In this module, you are encouraged to compare different models of computation,
write computer programs in a variety of different programming languages,
and identify computational problems in everyday computing.

The topic to be covered in this project[1] is the
**The Polynomial Time Complexity Class (P)**
